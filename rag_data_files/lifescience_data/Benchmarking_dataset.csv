"What is the primary motivation for incorporating conditional GANs, CIELAB color space, and CBAM in the image colorization workflow for grayscale cardiac organoid images?","In this section, we present an overview of our research on image colorization of grayscale cardiac organoids using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), specifically the Pix2Pix model [8].

Our research aims to address this limitation by employing conditional GANs, which have shown promising results in generating realistic and accurate colorizations from grayscale images. In this paper, we present a comprehensive workflow for cardiac organoid image colorization, highlighting the motivations behind using conditional GANs for this specific task. Our methodology is built around utilizing the Pix2Pix conditional GAN [8], the Pix2Pix model, short for ”Pixel-toPixel Translation,” is a notable example of a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). GANs are a class of deep learning architectures that involve two networks, a generator, and a discriminator, engaged in a competitive learning process. In the context of image colorization, the Pix2Pix model learns to map input grayscale images to corresponding colorized versions by leveraging a training dataset that contains pairs of grayscale and color images. By doing so, the model can generate plausible and realistic colorizations that align with the original context of the grayscale input. Pix2Pix has garnered attention due to its ability to capture intricate relationships between input and output images, making it a compelling choice for various image translation tasks, including our focus on cardiac organoid image colorization. This robust pix2pix deep-learning framework is proficient in mapping input grayscale images to their corresponding colorized versions. To achieve this, we adopt the CIELAB color space, consisting of three channels: Lightness, a*, and b* [as per figure]. In CIELAB, Lightness represents the grayscale channel, while a* and b* represent the two-color channels. This Lightness channel will serve as the conditional input to the generator, and the a* and b* channels will be the target channels for generating colorized versions of the grayscale images. The objective of using CIELAB color space is to extract only the color information from the cardiac organoid and train the model to generate the plausible colors of a* & b* that will be merged on the grayscale input, to obtain the colorized cardiac organoid. 7 The copyright holder for this preprint bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.15.575724 ; this version posted January 16, 2024.

It is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license . Additionally, we have incorporated the Convolution Block Attention Module (CBAM) [24] to increase the channel and spatial attention of the GAN model to focus on the relevant features. CBAM is an innovative enhancement introduced to the architecture of deep neural networks, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CBAM integrates both channel and spatial attention mechanisms, facilitating the model’s ability to focus on pertinent features within the input data. Channel attention enables the network to adaptively assign importance to different channels, emphasizing relevant information while suppressing noise. Simultaneously, spatial attention ensures that the network allocates its focus to meaningful spatial regions within an image. By integrating CBAM into our conditional GAN framework, we aim to improve the model’s ability to capture salient features in grayscale cardiac organoid images. This attention mechanism enhances the quality and fidelity of the generated colorizations by directing the model’s focus toward critical regions within the image. The primary motivation for incorporating conditional GANs, CIELAB color space, and CBAM is to increase the model’s attention to relevant features and limit the model’s predictions to only two channels (i.e a* & b*), thereby reducing the number of predictions compared to the RGB color space, where the model would have to make predictions for the R, G, B channels. The synergy between Pix2Pix, CIELAB, and CBAM contributes to notable colorization outcomes. To provide a visual representation of our image colorization workflow, we present an overview figure (Figure 1) that illustrates the main components and steps of the process. The figure depicts the transformation of a grayscale cardiac organoid image to a fully colorized output using Pix2Pix conditional GAN. The conditional input passed to the Generator is the Lightness channel and the Discriminator is trained on the a* & b* channels.","The primary motivation for incorporating conditional GANs, CIELAB color space, and CBAM is to increase the model's attention to relevant features and limit the model's predictions to only two channels (i.e., a* & b*).

       The use of conditional GANs, specifically the Pix2Pix model, enables the transformation of grayscale images into their colorized versions while preserving the original structural details. The conditional input, which is the Lightness channel from CIELAB color space, represents the grayscale information and helps the model pay more attention to the details.

       The inclusion of CBAM (Convolution Block Attention Module) in the network further enhances the model's ability to capture fine details and pay more attention to the relevant regions in the image.

       The CIELAB color space is used because it is a perceptually uniform color space, which means that the color differences are perceived similarly by the human eye. This property is essential for accurate colorization, as it ensures that the colorized image closely resembles the original image in terms of color perception.

       In summary, the use of conditional GANs, CIELAB color space, and CBAM in the image colorization workflow for grayscale cardiac organoid images aims to improve the accuracy, robustness, and perceptual quality of the colorized images.","and CBAM contributes to notable colorization outcomes. \nTo provide a visual representation of our image colorization workflow, we present an overview figure \n(Figure 1) that illustrates the main components and steps of the process.

Furthermore, the addition of even more sequences continued to enhance the model's performance, although at a diminishing rate. This trend mirrors findings from the OpenFold model, indicating that the accuracy of protein modeling experiences a rapid increase with a growing number of training systems, followed by more gradual enhancements with additional systems.",,,,,

colorizations that convincingly fool the discriminator into classifying them as real.

"How was the modeling of individual amino acid structures performed using GPT-4, and what limitations were encountered with GPT-3.5 in the same context?"," Methods 
Prompt-based modeling with GPT-4 
Modeling of individual amino acid structures was performed by challenging GPT-4 through the 
ChatGPT interface [20, 21] with a single prompt (Table 1a), one amino acid residue at a time. For 
each individual amino acid, the same prompt was used for five consecutive iterations with each 
iteration initiated in a new dialog. GPT-4 was run in classic mode without “browser” and “analysis” 
features enabled, formerly known as “web browser” and “code interpreter” plug-ins, respectively 
[59]. Classic mode limits processing to GPT-4 with no additional capabilities. Amino acid modeling 
was also performed with GPT-3.5 in the same manner. However, GPT-3.5 would frequently 
generate PDB file output with missing or extra atoms. In such cases, responses were regenerated 
within each GPT-3.5 dialog until PDB file output contained the correct number of atoms required 
for analysis. Modeling of ?-helix structures was performed by challenging GPT-4 running the 
Wolfram plugin [60] through the ChatGPT interface with an initial prompt followed by up to two 
refinement prompts in the same dialog, for a total of up to three attempts (Table 1b). The same 
prompt was used for five rounds of ten consecutive iterations with each iteration initiated in a new 
dialog.   
Analysis of generated structures 
Structures were analyzed by using the UCSF ChimeraX [42]. For amino acid structures, the 
“distance” (for bond lengths) and “angle” (for bond angles) commands were used with atom 
specification tailored to each amino acid type. Experimentally determined amino acid backbone 
bond lengths (N-C?, 1.458Å; C?-C, 1.525Å; C-O 1.231Å) [38], backbone bond angles (N-C?-C, 
111.0°; C?-C-O, 120.1°) [39], and sidechain bond lengths and bond angles (Table S4) [40] served 
as references for evaluating predicted amino acid structures. Sidechain bond lengths and bond 
angles, obtained from a backbone-dependent rotamer library built into ChimeraX, represent those 
in which the backbone dihedral angles are ?=180° (typical of trans peptide bonds), ?=180°, and 
?=180° [40, 42]. For GPT-4, one iteration of cysteine lacked the backbone O atom and one 
iteration of methionine lacked the sidechain C? atom. Thus, these single iterations (n=1) from 
were excluded from analyses involving the missing atoms.

 For ?-helix structures, the matchmaker tool was used for alignment and RMSD determination 
across all atom pairs by using its default parameters (i.e., best-aligning pair). An experimentally 
determined ?-helical structure consisting of 10 consecutive alanine residues, detected within an 
engineered form of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme (PDB ID 1L64) [48], was used as the reference 
for evaluating the modeled ?-helix structures. The AlphaFold2 ?-helix structure was modeled 
using ColabFold [61] through ChimeraX run with default parameters (i.e., minimization and 
without templates usage) using an elongated polyalanine sequence as input (Table S5 and Fig. 
S5a). The ChimeraX and PyMOL (version 2.5.7) ?-helix structures were modeled by using the 
build structure command and fab command, respectively, each by using a 10-residue alanine 
sequence as input and run with default ?-helix parameters (i.e., backbone dihedral angles set to 
?=-57° and ?=-47°) (Fig. S5, b and c). All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 10.1.0 
(GraphPad Software). Statistical details are reported in the figure legends and statistical 
measurements include mean, mean ± SD, and mean ± range. 
Prompt-based interaction analysis with GPT-4 
Structural analysis of binding interaction was performed by providing GPT-4 with an input PDB 
file and prompting as described (Table 1B) through the ChatGPT interface. The PDB file used as 
input was unmodified as obtained from the PDB entry for PDB ID: 7VH8 [49]. It should be noted 
that PDB ID: 7VH8 refers to nirmatrelvir as PF-07321332. ChimeraX was used to analyze amino 
acid residues detected by GPT-4 to interact with nirmatrelvir. The “contacts” and “distance” 
commands were used to verify interactions. For this exercise, GPT-4 was not limited to classic 
mode. Rather the “browser” and “analysis” features were enabled within the ChatGPT interface 
to enable file input, a feature available for GPT-4 but not GPT-3.5. Only the “analysis” feature was 
engaged for the responses generated by GPT-4 ","Modeling of individual amino acid structures involved challenging GPT-4 through the ChatGPT interface with a single prompt for each amino acid residue.
